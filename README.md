A simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher in Python. The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.                                                                                                                             
**Introduction:**                                                                                                                                                                                                      
    The Caesar Cipher is named after Julius Caesar, who used this encryption technique in his private correspondence. It is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. Despite its simplicity, it provides a good introduction to the principles of encryption.                                                       
**How It Works:**                                                                                                                                                     
1. **Shift/Key**: Each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places according to the specified key (shift value).                                    
2. **Alphabet Wrap-Around**: The alphabet is treated as circular, so after 'Z' it wraps around to 'A'.                                                                
3. **Case Sensitivity**: The cipher preserves the case of the original letters.                                                                                       
4. **Non-Alphabetic Characters**: Characters that are not alphabetic are not changed.
